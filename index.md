My name is Cartland Zhou, and I am a Political Science Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). My core research seeks to model and answer questions regarding conflict initiation and dynamics as a result of great power politics and arms transfers. I also have research interests in computer vision to develop novel techniques that supplement my core research, such as optical character and object recognition. My dissertation is a book project examining mechanisms under which great powers leverage arms transfers for geopolitical strategic gains and their implications for interstate disputes and conflicts. I am a 2024-2025 Hans J. Morgenthau fellow and a 2023-2024 Alice Belkin fellow.
